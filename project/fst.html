								<p> During the first years of college, I felt that the subjects were all too theoretical. I felt the need for something more practical, something more hands-on.  That was when I enrolled in the Formula Student Técnico (FST) team, particularly the suspension department.

								</p>

								<hr />

								<p><span class="image left"><img src="/images/fst2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									I was responsible to develop two components: the upright and the hub. The upright, on the left, is located inside the wheel. It is responsible to perform the connection between the rotating and stationary parts, that is, the drivetrain and suspension, respectively. 

								</p>

								

								<p> 
									The Upright is one of the most complex parts of the car, due to the fact that it requires to accommodate different components, such as the hub, planetary transmission, oil seals, and bearings on the inside. It also supports the brake calipers, motor, and other components as illustrated on the exploded assembly below.

								<hr />

								<p>
									To ensure the upright would withstand the loads applied during service Finite Element Analyses, FEA, were performed. Different load cases were considered and evaluated using Hypermesh. The results for one load case can be found in the animation.

									This part was made out of 7075-T6 and machined in a 5-axis CNC in a sponsoring company. An iterative process with the sponsor was required to ensure the part could be manufactured. In order to do so, the technical drawings were developed represented in the following image. 

								</p>

								<span class="image fit"><img src="/images/fst5.jpg" width="100%" alt="" /></span>
								
								<p>Being involved in this project allowed me to improve my 3D design skills to a proficient level, my technical drawing capabilities, and bill of materials elaboration, along with my interpersonal skills. As in any project, difficulties tend to arise, consequently problem-solving and having a resourceful mindset were crucial capabilities, which I highly developed throughout this experience. It was also important for me to have studied the previous prototypes, as it allowed me to anticipate and mitigate possible upcoming problems. While working with a team of more than forty members, teamwork was essential to ensure that the project objectives were met. In the end, the prototype, FST09e, surpassed the defined goals and was even one of the best-qualified cars ever developed at Instituto Superior Técnico, achieving the 9<sup>th</sup> place overall in the FS Germany.
